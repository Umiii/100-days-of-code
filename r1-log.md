## Log

### Day 0: April 18th, 2021
Installed cypress for test project on https://www.saucedemo.com/

Today's Progress: Completed Login validation test

Thoughts: The cross-origin fix is standard and very easy to implement


### Day 1: April 19th, 2021

Fixed Webpack error

Completed Invalid Authentication Test Cases

Penned down test case scenarios for add to cart

Thoughts: Cypress has some reasonable bugs that are still open on Github, the Webpack error was a major headacheclea

### Day 1: April 20th, 2021
